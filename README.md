# Architect-Template-clone-not-responsive

This is a clone of the W3Schools Architect template, which is built using the HTML, CSS by myself. The website features a header with a navigation bar and a large banner image, with several sections below providing information about the website's services, team members, and contact information.
Initially, this website clone was not responsive and had fixed dimensions that may not have adapted well to different screen sizes. However, I have also created a responsive version of this clone and it can be found in a separate repository.
The responsive version of the website clone is built using the same HTML, CSS as the non-responsive version. However, it includes additional CSS media queries that allow the website's layout to adjust to different screen sizes.
